## Contributing
To contribute to DJ-Helper development, start with making a fork of the repository. Do the changes in your fork, and make a pull request when you are happy with them.

We use a loose version of [GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html). Most importantly, everything starts with an issue or discussion.

## Roadmap
The main goal of this project is to make a very userfriendly bot. Users should be able to operate it at all stages of a real party!

It should have great playlist system. The bot should be able to automatically generate playlists from Youtube, Spotify and other popular streamingservices' playlists, so the users dont have to do redo their playlists.

It should be stable, and have good sound quality. Nothing poops on the party as a DJ struggeling to get sound in the speakers. The sound should be adjustable with normal soundfilters.

Offer MP3 conversions of everything that the bot can stream.

The roadmap is to:
- Finish the basic player
- Integrate with dropbox for large file support
- Add soundfilters
